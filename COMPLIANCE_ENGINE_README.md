## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Architecture Patterns
- **Abstract Base Classes** for regulation checker extensibility
- **Factory Pattern** for regulation-specific implementations
- **Dataclass Structures** for type safety and validation
- **Async/Await Support** for scalable operations
- **Cryptographic Integrity** with SHA-256 hashing

### Data Structures
```python
@dataclass
class ComplianceResult:
    requirement_id: str
    requirement_name: str
    status: ComplianceStatus
    risk_level: RiskLevel
    current_state: str
    required_state: str
    gap_analysis: str
    remediation_steps: List[str]
    evidence: Dict[str, Any]
    confidence_score: float
```

### Monte Carlo Risk Simulation
```python
# Sample risk factor modeling
RiskFactor(
    factor_id="gdpr_data_breach",
    probability_distribution="beta",
    probability_params={"alpha": 2, "beta": 8, "scale": 0.1},
    impact_distribution="triangular", 
    impact_params={"left": 50000, "mode": 500000, "right": 20000000}
)
```

### Policy Template System
```python
PolicyTemplate(
    policy_type=PolicyType.PRIVACY_POLICY,
    regulation=RegulationType.GDPR,
    sections=["Data Controller Information", "Legal Basis", ...],
    required_elements=["controller_identity", "legal_basis", ...],
    compliance_points=["Article 13", "Article 14", ...]
)
```

## 📊 Assessment Capabilities

### Compliance Scoring Algorithm
```python
def calculate_compliance_score(results: List[ComplianceResult]) -> float:
    weighted_score = sum(
        result.confidence_score * weight_for_requirement(result)
        for result in results if result.status == ComplianceStatus.COMPLIANT
    )
    total_weight = sum(weight_for_requirement(result) for result in results)
    return (weighted_score / total_weight) * 100 if total_weight > 0 else 0
```

### Risk Level Determination
- **CRITICAL** (90-100): Immediate action required
- **VERY HIGH** (75-89): Urgent remediation needed
- **HIGH** (50-74): High priority remediation
- **MEDIUM** (25-49): Moderate risk management
- **LOW** (10-24): Standard monitoring
- **VERY LOW** (0-9): Minimal risk exposure
