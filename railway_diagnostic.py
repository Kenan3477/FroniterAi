print("\n📋 Troubleshooting Steps:")

print("\n1. 🔄 **Check Railway Dashboard**:")
print("   - Go to your Railway project")
print("   - Look at the 'Deployments' tab")
print("   - Ensure the latest deployment is active")
print("   - Check if it shows the new timestamp")

print("\n2. 🔑 **Verify Environment Variable**:")
print("   - Go to Variables tab in Railway")
print("   - Confirm GITHUB_TOKEN is set")
print("   - Value should start with 'github_pat_'")

print("\n3. 📊 **Check Deployment Logs**:")
print("   - In Railway, click on your latest deployment")
print("   - View the logs")
print("   - Look for:")
print("     ✅ '💓 GITHUB HEARTBEAT MONITORING - ENABLED'")
print("     ✅ '✅ GITHUB_TOKEN environment variable found!'")
print("     ✅ '💓 GitHub Heartbeat Monitor is ACTIVE!'")

print("\n4. 🌐 **Test Your Railway URL**:")
print("   - Get your Railway public URL")
print("   - Visit: [YOUR_URL]/api/heartbeat-status")
print("   - Should return JSON with GitHub connection status")

print("\n5. 🔄 **Force Browser Refresh**:")
print("   - Press Ctrl+F5 (or Cmd+Shift+R on Mac)")
print("   - This clears browser cache")
print("   - You should see the new dashboard with heartbeat monitor")

print("\n6. ⏱️  **Wait for Data**:")
print("   - The system may show 'initializing' at first")
print("   - GitHub data fetching takes 30-60 seconds")
print("   - Refresh after 2-3 minutes")

print("\n🎯 **Expected Results After Fix**:")
print("✅ Dashboard shows '💓 GitHub Connection Monitor' section")
print("✅ Heartbeat status shows 'Connected' or 'Initializing'")
print("✅ File counts: ~98 total files, ~25 Python files")
print("✅ Real-time updates every 5 seconds")

print("\n🆘 **If Still Not Working**:")
print("1. Check Railway logs for errors")
print("2. Verify the deployment actually updated")
print("3. Try visiting /api/heartbeat-status directly")
print("4. Clear browser cache completely")

print("\n📞 **Next Steps**:")
print("1. Follow the troubleshooting steps above")
print("2. Check your Railway deployment logs")
print("3. Report back what you see in the logs")
print("4. Try the /api/heartbeat-status endpoint")

print("\n🎉 **Your system IS working** - we just need to ensure Railway is serving the latest version!")
