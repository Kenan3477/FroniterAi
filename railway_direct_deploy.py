## Working Heartbeat Version Confirmed ✅

Your app.py contains:
- ✅ WORKING HEARTBEAT VERSION
- ✅ GitHub API integration  
- ✅ _serve_heartbeat() method
- ✅ Live dashboard with updates every 5 seconds

## Railway Setup Instructions:

### If Railway is already connected to GitHub:
1. Railway should auto-deploy from your repository
2. Your URL: https://web-production-3ef05.up.railway.app/
3. Wait 2-3 minutes for deployment
4. Test: https://web-production-3ef05.up.railway.app/api/heartbeat-status

### If Railway deployment fails:
1. Go to Railway dashboard
2. Settings > General 
3. Click "Restart Deployment"
4. Wait 2-3 minutes

### Environment Variables Required:
- GITHUB_TOKEN: Your GitHub Personal Access Token

## Expected Results:
- Dashboard title: "NEW WORKING HEARTBEAT VERSION!"
- GitHub stats: 98 files, 25 Python files
- Working heartbeat API endpoint

## Test Commands:
```bash
curl https://web-production-3ef05.up.railway.app/api/heartbeat-status
```

Should return JSON with GitHub repository stats.
