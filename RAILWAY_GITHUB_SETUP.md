# ðŸš€ RAILWAY AUTONOMOUS EVOLUTION SETUP GUIDE ðŸš€

## Step 1: Create GitHub Personal Access Token

1. Go to GitHub Settings â†’ Developer settings â†’ Personal access tokens â†’ Tokens (classic)
2. Click "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Name it: "Railway Autonomous Evolution"
4. Select scopes:
   - âœ… `repo` (Full control of private repositories)
   - âœ… `workflow` (Update GitHub Action workflows)
   - âœ… `write:packages` (Upload packages to GitHub Package Registry)
5. Click "Generate token"
6. **COPY THE TOKEN** (you won't see it again!)

## Step 2: Add Environment Variables to Railway

1. Go to your Railway project dashboard
2. Click on your service â†’ Variables tab
3. Add these environment variables:

```
GITHUB_TOKEN=your_personal_access_token_here
GITHUB_REPO=Kenan3477/FroniterAi
GITHUB_USER=Kenan3477
```

## Step 3: Configure Git in Railway

The system will automatically configure Git with your credentials using the environment variables.

## Step 4: Test Autonomous Evolution

Once deployed, your Railway system will be able to:
- âœ… Clone your repository
- âœ… Generate autonomous code
- âœ… Commit changes with AI messages
- âœ… Push to your GitHub repository

## Step 5: Verification

Visit your Railway dashboard and check the logs for:
```
ðŸ¤– AUTONOMOUS EVOLUTION: Generating code...
âœ… COMMITTED: autonomous_improvement_xxx.py
ðŸš€ PUSHED: Changes to GitHub repository
```

## Security Notes

- The GitHub token allows Railway to write to your repository
- All commits will be signed as coming from your GitHub account
- You can revoke the token anytime in GitHub settings

## What Will Happen

Every 30 minutes, your deployed Railway system will:
1. Generate new Python files with autonomous improvements
2. Commit them to your GitHub repository
3. Push the changes automatically
4. Show real commit counts on your dashboard

Your Railway deployment will now be TRULY self-evolving with real GitHub commits!
