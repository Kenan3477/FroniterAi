# üöÄ Frontier AI Railway Deployment Guide

## Quick Deploy to Railway

### Method 1: One-Click Deploy (Recommended)
1. **Connect to Railway**
   - Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
   - Click "Deploy Now"
   - Connect your GitHub account
   - Select your FroniterAi repository

2. **Automatic Configuration**
   - Railway will automatically detect your `railway.json` and `Procfile`
   - It will install dependencies from `requirements.txt`
   - The system will start with `python app.py`

### Method 2: Railway CLI Deploy
```bash
# Install Railway CLI
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Login to Railway
railway login

# Deploy from your project directory
cd /path/to/Frontier
railway up
```

### Method 3: Manual Setup
1. **Create New Project**
   - Go to railway.app
   - Click "New Project"
   - Choose "Deploy from GitHub repo"
   - Select your FroniterAi repository

2. **Environment Variables** (Set in Railway Dashboard)
   ```
   PORT=8889
   PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1
   RAILWAY_ENVIRONMENT=production
   ```

3. **Custom Domain** (Optional)
   - Go to your Railway project dashboard
   - Click "Settings" ‚Üí "Domains"
   - Add your custom domain

## üîß Configuration Details

### Files Configured for Railway:
- ‚úÖ `app.py` - Optimized entry point
- ‚úÖ `railway.json` - Railway configuration
- ‚úÖ `Procfile` - Process definition
- ‚úÖ `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies
- ‚úÖ `Dockerfile` - Container configuration
- ‚úÖ `.dockerignore` - Build optimization

### Deployment Options:
Railway will automatically choose the best deployment method:
1. **Dockerfile** (Recommended) - Uses container for consistent environment
2. **Nixpacks** - Automatic buildpack detection
3. **Buildpacks** - Traditional buildpack approach

### Expected Deployment:
- **Build Time**: ~2-3 minutes
- **Start URL**: `https://your-app.up.railway.app`
- **Health Check**: Automatic on `/`
- **Auto-restart**: On failure with 10 retries

## üåê Live URLs After Deployment

Your Frontier AI will be available at:
- **ü§ñ Main Business Dashboard**: `https://your-app.up.railway.app/`
- **üß¨ Evolution Monitor**: `https://your-app.up.railway.app/evolution`
- **API Chat Endpoint**: `https://your-app.up.railway.app/api/chat`
- **System Stats API**: `https://your-app.up.railway.app/api/stats`

### Interface Features:
- **Business Dashboard** (`/`): Conversational AI, financial analysis, business formation, web development
- **Evolution Monitor** (`/evolution`): Real-time AI self-improvement monitoring, task management, performance metrics

## üìä Monitoring

Railway provides built-in monitoring:
- **Logs**: Real-time application logs
- **Metrics**: CPU, Memory, Network usage
- **Deployments**: History and rollback options

## ÔøΩ Local Docker Testing (Optional)

Before deploying to Railway, you can test locally with Docker:

### Quick Docker Test:
```bash
# Build the image
docker build -t frontier-ai .

# Run the container
docker run -p 8889:8889 frontier-ai

# Test the deployment
curl http://localhost:8889
```

### Full Stack with Docker Compose:
```bash
# Start all services
docker-compose up -d

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f frontier-ai

# Stop services
docker-compose down
```

## ÔøΩüö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
1. **Build Fails**: Check `requirements.txt` dependencies
2. **App Won't Start**: Verify `app.py` main function
3. **Health Check Fails**: Ensure web server binds to `0.0.0.0:$PORT`

### Debug Commands:
```bash
# View logs
railway logs

# Check build status
railway status

# Restart service
railway up --detach
```

## üéØ Post-Deployment Checklist

- [ ] Verify business dashboard loads at Railway URL (`/`)
- [ ] Test conversational AI chat interface
- [ ] Check evolution monitor dashboard (`/evolution`)
- [ ] Verify real-time evolution system monitoring
- [ ] Test task creation in evolution monitor
- [ ] Check all API endpoints respond
- [ ] Confirm business operations modules work
- [ ] Test navigation between both interfaces
- [ ] Set up custom domain (optional)
- [ ] Configure monitoring alerts
