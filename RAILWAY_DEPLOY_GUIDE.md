## 🔧 Configuration Details

### Files Configured for Railway:
- ✅ `app.py` - Optimized entry point
- ✅ `railway.json` - Railway configuration
- ✅ `Procfile` - Process definition
- ✅ `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies

### Expected Deployment:
- **Build Time**: ~2-3 minutes
- **Start URL**: `https://your-app.up.railway.app`
- **Health Check**: Automatic on `/`
- **Auto-restart**: On failure with 10 retries

## 🌐 Live URLs After Deployment

Your Frontier AI will be available at:
- **Main Dashboard**: `https://your-app.up.railway.app/`
- **API Endpoint**: `https://your-app.up.railway.app/api/chat`
- **System Stats**: `https://your-app.up.railway.app/api/stats`

## 📊 Monitoring

Railway provides built-in monitoring:
- **Logs**: Real-time application logs
- **Metrics**: CPU, Memory, Network usage
- **Deployments**: History and rollback options

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
1. **Build Fails**: Check `requirements.txt` dependencies
2. **App Won't Start**: Verify `app.py` main function
3. **Health Check Fails**: Ensure web server binds to `0.0.0.0:$PORT`

### Debug Commands:
```bash
# View logs
railway logs

# Check build status
railway status

# Restart service
railway up --detach
```
