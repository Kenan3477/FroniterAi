- `@pytest.mark.jurisdiction`: Jurisdiction-specific compliance tests
- `@pytest.mark.regulatory_change`: Regulatory change detection tests
- `@pytest.mark.performance`: Performance and load tests
- `@pytest.mark.integration`: Integration and end-to-end tests
- `@pytest.mark.database`: Database integration tests
- `@pytest.mark.api`: API integration tests

## Best Practices

### Test Design
1. **Isolation**: Each test should be independent and not rely on other tests
2. **Repeatability**: Tests should produce consistent results across runs
3. **Clarity**: Test names and documentation should clearly indicate purpose
4. **Coverage**: Aim for comprehensive coverage of compliance scenarios
5. **Performance**: Include performance validation in all test scenarios

### Data Management
1. **Cleanup**: Always clean up test data after test execution
2. **Isolation**: Use separate test data for each test scenario
3. **Realism**: Generate realistic test data that represents actual use cases
4. **Privacy**: Ensure test data doesn't contain real personal information
5. **Scalability**: Design test data generation to scale with test requirements

### Error Handling
1. **Validation**: Validate all inputs and outputs thoroughly
2. **Graceful Degradation**: Test system behavior under failure conditions
3. **Recovery**: Validate error recovery and rollback mechanisms
4. **Logging**: Ensure comprehensive logging for debugging and analysis
5. **Monitoring**: Include monitoring and alerting validation in tests

## Contributing

When adding new compliance tests:

1. Follow the existing test structure and naming conventions
2. Include appropriate pytest markers for categorization
3. Add performance validation for new compliance operations
4. Update configuration files with new regulation or industry parameters
5. Include comprehensive documentation and usage examples
6. Ensure test isolation and cleanup procedures
