# Frontier Evolution AI System

## Overview
The Frontier Evolution AI System is designed to autonomously review and enhance the codebase of the FrontierAI GitHub repository. By identifying potential upgrades and missing implementations, this self-evolving system aims to improve the overall capabilities of the FrontierAI project. The system tracks progress and analyzes the benefits of each enhancement, ensuring continuous improvement.

## Features
- **Code Analysis**: Automatically reviews all files in the repository to identify issues and opportunities for upgrades.
- **Implementation Planning**: Generates detailed plans for implementing identified upgrades, including documentation of steps taken.
- **Progress Tracking**: Monitors the evolution process and provides reports on progress and outcomes.
- **Benefits Analysis**: Evaluates the impact of implemented changes on system performance and capabilities.
