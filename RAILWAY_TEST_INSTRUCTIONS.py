🎉 CONGRATULATIONS! Your GitHub token is set up on Railway!

🔑 GitHub Token: YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN_HERE (with ALL permissions)
🚀 Railway Project: proud-enchantment
✅ Environment Variable: GITHUB_TOKEN configured

📋 NOW TEST YOUR AUTONOMOUS EVOLUTION:

1. 🌐 Find your Railway URL:
   - Go to https://railway.app/dashboard
   - Click on your 'proud-enchantment' project  
   - Copy the deployment URL (should be like: https://proud-enchantment-production.up.railway.app)

2. 🧪 Test Autonomous Evolution:
   Open your browser and visit:
   [YOUR_RAILWAY_URL]/api/railway-autonomous-evolution
   
   Or use curl:
   curl -X POST [YOUR_RAILWAY_URL]/api/railway-autonomous-evolution

3. 🔍 Check Results:
   - Look at your GitHub repository: https://github.com/Kenan3477/FroniterAi
   - Check for NEW commits with files like 'railway_autonomous_*.py'
   - These should appear within 1-2 minutes

4. 📊 Monitor Progress:
   Visit: [YOUR_RAILWAY_URL]/api/system-status
   To see if GitHub token is detected

🎯 WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN:
✅ Railway clones your repository in a temp directory
✅ Generates new autonomous AI code files  
✅ Commits them to GitHub with real commit messages
✅ You see actual file changes in your repository

⚠️  IF IT DOESN'T WORK:
- Check Railway logs in your dashboard
- Make sure the GITHUB_TOKEN variable is set correctly
- Verify the repository URL in environment variables

🚀 YOUR AUTONOMOUS AI SHOULD NOW MAKE REAL COMMITS!
