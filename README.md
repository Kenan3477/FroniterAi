## 🔐 Authentication System

Frontier includes a comprehensive, production-ready authentication system featuring:

### Core Features
- **JWT Token Management**: Access & refresh tokens with Redis session storage
- **User Management**: Subscription tiers (Basic/Professional/Enterprise)
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Hierarchical permissions system
- **API Key Support**: Enterprise-level API key authentication
- **Rate Limiting**: Subscription-based limits with Redis backend
- **Input Validation**: Advanced security scanning and sanitization

### Quick Start

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from api.middleware.auth import setup_authentication

app = FastAPI()

# Setup complete authentication system
auth_manager = setup_authentication(
    app=app,
    redis_url="redis://localhost:6379",
    database_url="postgresql://user:pass@host/db",
    secret_key="your-secret-key"
)

# Protect endpoints
from api.middleware.auth import require_auth, require_professional_tier

@app.get("/api/user/profile")
async def get_profile(user: Dict = Depends(require_auth)):
    return {"user_id": user["user_id"]}

@app.get("/api/analysis/advanced")
async def advanced_features(user: Dict = Depends(require_professional_tier)):
    return {"message": "Advanced features available"}
```

### Security Features
- **Comprehensive Input Validation**: SQL injection, XSS, path traversal protection
- **Security Headers**: Production-ready security headers
- **Audit Logging**: Detailed security event logging
- **Rate Limiting**: Distributed rate limiting with sliding windows
- **Token Management**: Secure token generation with blacklisting support
