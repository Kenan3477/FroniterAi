analyzer = CompetitiveIntelligenceAnalyzer()

# Define FrontierAI capabilities
frontier_capabilities = {
    'language_understanding': 7.2,
    'code_generation': 6.8,
    'reasoning': 6.5,
    'multimodal': 5.2,
    'safety': 7.8,
    'efficiency': 6.9
}

# Analyze competitive landscape
intelligence = await analyzer.analyze_capabilities(frontier_capabilities)

# Access insights
print("Capability Gaps:", intelligence.capability_gaps)
print("Improvement Opportunities:", intelligence.improvement_opportunities)
print("Benchmark Comparisons:", intelligence.benchmark_comparisons)

# Generate comprehensive report
report = analyzer.generate_competitive_report(intelligence)
```
