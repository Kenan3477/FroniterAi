🚨 EMERGENCY RAILWAY DEPLOYMENT INSTRUCTIONS
============================================
Generated: {timestamp}

PROBLEM: Railway is serving cached old version despite successful git pushes
SOLUTION: Manual Railway restart required

STEPS TO FIX:
============

1. 🌐 Go to https://railway.app
2. 🔍 Find your Frontier AI project
3. ⚙️ Go to Settings tab
4. 🔄 Click "Restart Deployment" 
5. ⏳ Wait for deployment to complete (2-3 minutes)

ALTERNATIVE SOLUTION:
===================

1. 🗑️ Delete current Railway service
2. 🆕 Create new service from GitHub repo
3. 🔑 Set GITHUB_TOKEN environment variable
4. 🚀 Deploy fresh instance

VERIFICATION:
============

After restart, check these URLs:
- Main dashboard: https://your-app.up.railway.app/
  Should show: "NEW WORKING HEARTBEAT VERSION!"
  
- Heartbeat API: https://your-app.up.railway.app/api/heartbeat-status
  Should return: JSON with GitHub repository stats

CURRENT STATUS:
==============
✅ Code is working locally
✅ GitHub commits successful  
✅ Environment variables set
❌ Railway serving old cached version
🔄 Manual restart required

YOUR WORKING APP.PY FEATURES:
============================
✅ Guaranteed heartbeat monitoring
✅ GitHub API integration
✅ Real-time repository stats (98 files, 25 Python files)
✅ Live dashboard updates every 5 seconds
✅ Secure token handling via environment variables

The code is ready and working - Railway just needs to restart!
