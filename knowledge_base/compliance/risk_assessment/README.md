# Risk Assessment Methodologies

## Overview

Comprehensive risk assessment frameworks and methodologies for evaluating compliance risks across different regulations, industries, and organizational contexts. These methodologies provide systematic approaches to identify, assess, and mitigate compliance risks.

## Risk Assessment Framework

### Core Risk Assessment Components

#### 1. Risk Identification
**Objective**: Systematically identify potential compliance risks

**Methods**:
- Regulatory requirement mapping
- Business process analysis
- Stakeholder interviews
- Historical incident analysis
- Industry benchmark studies

**Outputs**:
- Comprehensive risk inventory
- Risk categorization matrix
- Risk source identification
- Impact area mapping

#### 2. Risk Analysis
**Objective**: Evaluate the likelihood and impact of identified risks

**Factors**:
- **Likelihood Assessment**:
  - Historical occurrence frequency
  - Current control effectiveness
  - Environmental factors
  - Organizational maturity

- **Impact Assessment**:
  - Financial impact
  - Regulatory penalties
  - Reputational damage
  - Operational disruption

#### 3. Risk Evaluation
**Objective**: Prioritize risks based on overall risk level

**Risk Matrix**:
```
Impact →     Low    Medium    High    Critical
Likelihood ↓
Very High    Med     High     Crit    Crit
High         Med     Med      High    Crit  
Medium       Low     Med      Med     High
Low          Low     Low      Med     Med
Very Low     Low     Low      Low     Med
```

**Risk Scoring**:
- Critical: Immediate action required
- High: Action required within 30 days
- Medium: Action required within 90 days
- Low: Monitor and review annually

#### 4. Risk Treatment
**Objective**: Develop and implement risk mitigation strategies

**Treatment Options**:
- **Avoid**: Eliminate the risk source
- **Mitigate**: Reduce likelihood or impact
- **Transfer**: Share risk through insurance or contracts
- **Accept**: Acknowledge and monitor residual risk

## Regulation-Specific Assessment Methodologies

□ Risk of reputational damage
□ Risk of financial loss
```

**Step 3: Mitigation Measures**
```
Technical Measures:

```

**DPIA Risk Matrix**:

| Risk Category | Low Risk | Medium Risk | High Risk |
|---------------|----------|-------------|-----------|
| Data Sensitivity | Non-sensitive personal data | Some sensitive elements | Special category data |
| Processing Scale | <1,000 individuals | 1,000-10,000 individuals | >10,000 individuals |
| Data Subject Impact | Minimal inconvenience | Some distress or inconvenience | Significant harm or distress |
| Mitigation Controls | Comprehensive controls | Adequate controls | Limited controls |

**Risk Treatment Requirements**:
- **Low Risk**: Standard privacy controls
- **Medium Risk**: Enhanced controls and monitoring
