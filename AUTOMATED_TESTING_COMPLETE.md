### Basic Test Generation
```python
from simulation_environment import AutomatedTestGenerator

test_generator = AutomatedTestGenerator()

# Define changes to test
changes = [
    {
        'type': 'file_create',
        'file': 'new_module.py',
        'content': '...'
    }
]

# Generate comprehensive test suite
test_suite = test_generator.generate_comprehensive_test_suite(changes)
print(f"Generated {len(test_suite)} tests across multiple categories")
```

### Test Execution and Reporting
```python
# Execute tests (simulated)
test_results = run_generated_tests(test_suite)

# Generate comprehensive report
report = test_generator.generate_test_execution_report(test_results, changes)

# Access key metrics
print(f"Success Rate: {report['summary']['success_rate']:.1f}%")
print(f"Deployment Ready: {report['deployment_readiness']['ready']}")
print(f"Risk Level: {report['deployment_readiness']['risk_level']}")
```

### Integration with Simulation
```python
# Simulation automatically generates and runs tests
result = await sim_env.run_simulation(changes, test_specs)

# Results include automated testing metrics
print(f"Test Coverage: {result.metrics.test_coverage}%")
print(f"Security Score: {result.metrics.security_score}")
